# 🎓 Vilnius Tech Portal – Redesigned Front-End Demo

> **A modern front-end redesign of the Vilnius Tech student portal**, created out of passion for my university and curiosity to imagine how the platform could look and feel with a modern touch.

Current Vilnius Tech university website: https://mano.vilniustech.lt

---

## 🌍 Overview

This project is a **front-end only** demo version of the Vilnius Tech student portal — reimagined from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s not an official version, but a **personal redesign concept**, built to visualize a more modern, aesthetic, and user-friendly experience.

I created this project simply because:
- I **really love my university (Vilnius Tech)** ❤️  
- The **current official website** feels a bit outdated in terms of UI/UX  
- I wanted to explore what a **modern, responsive, and theme-adaptive** design could look like for the platform

Everything you see was built **from zero**, by me, in about **3–4 hours** of focused work (yes — one sitting 😄).

## 💡 Project Highlights

- 🎨 **Completely redesigned UI**
  - Every section rebuilt from scratch with modern layouts and cleaner styling.
- 🌗 **Light / Dark Theme Toggle**
  - The current official website doesn’t support dark mode, which is something I personally prefer — especially during late-night study sessions.
- 🧠 **LocalStorage-based Demo Login**
  - There’s no real authentication. You can type **anything** in the login fields and enter the demo.
- 🧩 **Front-End Only**
  - No backend, no database. Everything is stored locally using `localStorage`.
- ⚙️ **Responsive Design**
  - Built to adapt to both desktop and mobile devices.
- 🧑‍🎓 **Vilnius Tech-inspired content**
  - Most of the existing site content is mirrored or lightly adjusted for the sake of realism.

## 🔮 Future Plans

Although this is a **demo-only version**, I plan to continue improving it when I have time:
- Add a **real login/register system**  
- Connect to a **backend (Node.js / Express)**  
- Implement **student dashboards, grades, notifications, etc.**  
- Add **real-time features** like announcements or course updates  
- Explore **API integration** for dynamic data

## 🕒 Development Time

This entire demo was designed and developed in **a single day (3–4 hours)**.  
It’s a personal experiment to test how fast I could turn an idea into a working visual prototype — and I’m really proud of the result.

## ❤️ Motivation

I built this purely because I **love Vilnius Tech** and wanted to see how its digital identity could evolve.  
It’s not a critique — it’s a creative exploration.  
Sometimes, redesigning what already exists helps us imagine **how much better things could be**.

"Innovating education through better design" ✨

Made with ❤️ for **VILNIUS TECH** University
